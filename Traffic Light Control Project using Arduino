Traffic Light Control Project using Arduino

The Arduino Traffic Light Control Mini Project is fun and educational as well, because it teaches kids and beginners how to use the Arduino board in controlling traffic lights. 
Using sensors and programming,you make the traffic lights change colors just like real ones do on the road. 
The project allows students to learn about both electronics and programming in a hands-on, 
interesting way, simulating the operation of traffic lights.
So pick up your Arduino board and start building your own traffic light control system today!
